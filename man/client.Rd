\description{
OneDrive and Sharepoint Online clients
}
\details{
These functions provide easy access to OneDrive and SharePoint in the cloud. Use \code{personal_onedrive} to access the drive for your personal account, and \code{business_onedrive} to access the drive for your work or school account. For \code{business_onedrive} and \code{sharepoint_site} to work, your organisation must have an appropriate Microsoft 365 license.

The default "common" tenant for \code{business_onedrive} and \code{sharepoint_site} attempts to detect your actual tenant from your currently logged-in account. This may not always succeed, for example if you have a personal account that is also a guest account in a tenant. In this case, supply the actual tenant name.
