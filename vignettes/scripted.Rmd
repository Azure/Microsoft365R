This vignette describes how to incorporate Microsoft365R into an automated (unattended) script, such as for a GitHub Actions workflow or other CI/CD process. There are a few steps involved:

- Create a new app registration and give it application permissions
- Use the app ID to authenticate and get an OAuth token
- Pass the token to the Microsoft365R functions
