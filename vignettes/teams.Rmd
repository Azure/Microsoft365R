Microsoft365R is a simple yet powerful R interface to [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365) (formerly known as Office 365), leveraging the facilities provided by the [AzureGraph](https://cran.r-project.org/package=AzureGraph) package. This vignette describes how to interact with [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), including sending messages and transferring files.

See the "Authenticating to Microsoft 365" vignette for more details on authentication if required.

## Teams

To access a team in Microsoft Teams, use the `get_team()` function and provide the team name or ID. You can also list the teams you're in with `list_teams()`. These return objects of R6 class `ms_team`.

```r
list_teams()
team <- get_team("My team")
```

The `ms_team` class has methods for working with channels and drives. Each team will generally have at least one drive, and possibly two: the default "Documents" drive, which is where uploaded files are stored, and the "Teams Wiki Data" drive, if the team has a wiki. Each team channel will have an associated folder in each drive, if at least one file has been uploaded to it.

```r
# list the channels in a team (including private channels you're a member of)
team$list_channels()

# get the primary channel for a team
team$get_channel()

# get a specific channel
team$get_channel("My channel")

# drives for a team
team$list_drives()
team$get_drive()
```

A drive is an `ms_drive` object, so the same methods apply as for OneDrives and SharePoint document libraries---see the "OneDrive and SharePoint" vignette for more information.

```r
drv <- team$get_drive()

# this will show one folder for each channel that has uploaded files
drv$list_files()

# if the team has a "General" channel, this upload will appear in that channel's "Files" tab
drv$upload_file("myfile.csv", "General/myfile.csv")
```

Note that the drives mentioned here are actually the document libraries of an underlying SharePoint site: as far as file storage is concerned, you can think of Teams as simply an alternative interface to functionality provided by SharePoint. The `ms_team` class in fact has a `get_sharepoint_site()` method to retrieve the backing site, and you can access the same files via the site's drive.

```r
site <- team$get_sharepoint_site()
site_drv <- site$get_drive()

# the previous upload will also appear in this file listing
site_drv$list_files("General")
```

## Channels

A team object has methods for listing, retrieving, creating and deleting channels. However you should not create and delete channels unnecessarily, since Teams tracks all channels ever created, even after you delete them.

In turn, a channel object has methods for listing and sending messages, and uploading and deleting files.

```r
chan <- team$get_channel()

# by default, retrieve only the 50 most recent messages
msgs <- chan$list_messages()

# retrieve the 100 most recent messages
chan$list_messages(n=100)

# retrieve all messages: set n = infinity
chan$list_messages(n=Inf)

# get a message by ID
msg <- chan$get_message(msgs[[1]]$properties$id)
```

You can send a message to a channel as plain text (the default) or HTML. For the latter, Teams imposes security restrictions on which HTML tags are allowed; you should limit your message to contain only basic formatting and no embedded scripts. See "Channel messages" below for more about the chat message object itself.

```r
chan$send_message("Hello from R")

chan$send_message("<body>Hello from <em>R</em></body>", content_type="html")

# send attachments by including a vector of filenames
chan$send_message("Hello with attachments", attachments=c("intro.md", "myfile.csv"))
```

Uploading a file to a channel will place it in the channel's folder. Note that message attachments are actually uploaded to the channel's folder and the message then includes a link to the uploaded file.

The channel object itself provides convenience functions to list, upload and download files. It also provides a `get_folder()` method to retrieve the file folder for the channel, as an `ms_drive_item` object; this object contains more general methods for working with files.

```r
chan$upload_file("myfile.docx")
chan$list_files()

chan_folder <- chan$get_folder()

# open the uploaded document for editing in Word Online
item <- chan_folder$get_item("myfile.docx")
item$open()

# download the edited document
chan$download_file("myfile.docx", overwrite=TRUE)
```

### Private channels

Private channels function much the same way as regular public channels, and the methods described above should also work with them. The main difference is that a private channel's files are stored in a separate SharePoint site to the public channels, so any files you upload to the private channel won't appear in the file listings for the main site.

## Channel messages

Teams channels are semi-threaded. Getting the list of messages for a channel retrieves only the top-level messages; to get the replies in a thread, you get the root message and then retrieve the replies to it.

A message object is of class `ms_chat_message`, and has custom methods to get replies, list all replies, and send a reply. Note that Teams doesn't have nested replies, so any methods dealing with replies will fail if the message object is itself a reply. The message body is part of the list of properties returned from the host, and can be found in the `properties` field along with other metadata.

```r
# get the most recent message
msg_list <- chan$list_messages()
msg_latest <- msg_list[[1]]

# body of message
msg_latest$properties$body

# 10 most recent replies
repl_list <- msg_latest$list_replies()

# send a reply
msg_latest$send_reply("Reply from R")

# send a reply with an attachment
msg_latest$send_reply("See attached file", attachments="reply.md")
```

Currently, Microsoft365R only supports messaging in channels. Support for chats between individuals may come later.
